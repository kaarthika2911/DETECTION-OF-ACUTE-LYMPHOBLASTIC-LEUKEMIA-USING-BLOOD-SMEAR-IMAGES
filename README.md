# DETECTION-OF-ACUTE-LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA-USING-BLOOD-SMEAR-IMAGES
Leukemia classification using CNNs (DenseNet, ResNet), PSO for feature selection, and HHWO/ChOA for optimization. FCNN, SVM, and Softmax used for classification. ChOA-FCNN and HHWO-FCNN show best results on leukemia image dataset. Combines deep learning with bio-optimization.
